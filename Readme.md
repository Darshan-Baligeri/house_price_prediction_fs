# House Price Prediction Web Application

Welcome to the **House Price Prediction** web application! This project leverages a pre-trained machine learning model to predict house prices based on various input features. Built using **Flask**, this web application allows users to input property details (e.g., area, number of rooms, etc.) and get an estimated price for the property.

## Setup and Installation

Follow the steps below to get this application running locally.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the application, ensure that you have the following:

- **Python 3.7 or higher**
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **Virtual environment** (recommended for isolated dependencies)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but highly recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On **Mac/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application Locally

To run the application on your local machine:

1. Start the Flask development server by running:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

2. Open a browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000). You should see the home page of the application.

## Deployment

### Hosting on Render

You can easily deploy this Flask application to **Render**, a cloud platform that automates web app deployment. Follow these steps:

1. **Push your repository** to GitHub or GitLab.
2. **Go to Render.com** and sign up or log in.
3. **Create a new Web Service** on Render.
4. Select **GitHub** as the repository source and choose your repository.
5. In the **Build Command**, use:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. In the **Start Command**, use:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
7. Render will automatically detect the web service and deploy it. Once done, you will receive a URL to access your app.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required for this project:

- `Flask==2.3.2`: A lightweight web framework for building the app.
- `pandas==1.5.3`: A powerful library for data manipulation, used here for processing input data.
- `scikit-learn==1.1.2`: A machine learning library that provides the tools for creating and using models.
- `requests==2.28.1`: A library for making HTTP requests, though it is not used in the core functionality of this app, it may be added in future for API calls.

To install these dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Key Fixes:

1. **Code Block Formatting**: The project structure is properly indented and placed inside triple backticks (```), making it render correctly in the GitHub markdown preview.
   
2. **Consistent Markdown Elements**:
   - Ensured consistent header (`##`) usage.
   - Lists are properly indented for nested items.

3. **Escaping Special Characters**: When placing code or file paths inside markdown, special characters like `#` are handled properly.

4. **Code Snippets**: Bash and Python code snippets are enclosed in triple backticks with the appropriate language identifier to improve readability.

This should ensure that the preview on GitHub looks neat and properly formatted.
